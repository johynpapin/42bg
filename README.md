# 42bg

A simple program in GO to draw a transparent red rectangle on an image to show the progress of learning kanji. The progress of learning is based on the number of kanjis in the KKLC book: 2300.

I realized this little script to motivate me to learn kanji, and to improve myself in GO. Indeed, I use the image produced as wallpaper.
